The linear gauge is a data visualization component that helps display numerical values on a linear scale. It has highly customizable features such as scales, pointers, ranges, and annotations.
The following samples are available for linear gauge to demonstrate the functionalities of each feature.

| Sample | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [Linear Gauge](LinearGauge/Samples/Default.xaml)| Linear gauge is a visual representation of numerical values of scales in a linear manner. This sample shows default rendering of a linear gauge.  |
| [Scales and Pointers](LinearGauge/Samples/ScaleAndPointers.xaml)| This sample shows the axis and pointer features in a linear gauge. Axes and pointers can be customized by using various options. |
| [Ranges](LinearGauge/Samples/Ranges.xaml)| This sample shows how to highlight a region in an axis by using ranges in a gauge. |
| [Annotations](LinearGauge/Samples/Annotation.xaml)| Annotations are used to mark a specific area of interest in a gauge with texts, shapes, or images. This sample shows the CPU utilization of a resource by using annotation feature. |
