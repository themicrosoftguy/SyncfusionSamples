The `SfRadialMenu` displays a hierarchical menu in a circular layout, which is optimized for touch enabled devices. Typically, it is used as a context menu, and it can expose more menu items in the same space than traditional menus.

The following samples are available for radial menu to demonstrate the functionalities of each feature.

| Sample | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|[Getting Started](RadialMenu/Samples/GettingStarted_RadialMenu)| It demonstrates the arrangement of sub menu items and its event like `Opened`,`Opening`,`Closed` and `Closing`.|
