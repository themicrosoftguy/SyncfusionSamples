Barcode provides a perfect approach to encode texts by using the supported symbol types that comprises one dimensional and two dimensional barcodes. The basic structure of a barcode consists of one or more data characters, optionally one or two check characters, a start pattern as well as a stop pattern.

The following samples are available for Barcode control to demonstrate the functionalities of each feature:

| Sample | Description |
