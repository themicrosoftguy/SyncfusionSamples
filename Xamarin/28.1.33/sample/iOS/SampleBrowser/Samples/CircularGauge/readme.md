The circular gauge is a data visualization component that helps display numerical values on a circular scale. It has highly customizable features, such as scales, pointers, ranges, and annotations.

The following samples are available for circular gauge to demonstrate the functionalities of each feature.

| Sample | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [Circular Gauge](CircularGaugeSample.cs)| A circular gauge is a visual representation of numerical values of scales in a circular manner. In this sample, a scale with needle pointer has been used.  |
| [Customization](GaugeCustomization.cs)| This sample shows how to customize gauge elements. Here a needle and a range pointer are added to show the current value. The gaugeâ€™s appearance can be customized by using options in the property setting. |
| [Direction Compass](DirectionCompass.cs)| A direction compass has been shown by adding needles and customizing labels to show the direction. |
| [Gradient Range](GradientRange.cs)| Gradient Range	This samples shows how to apply smooth color transition to a range by specifying different colors based on range values.  |
| [Pointer Customization](Pointers.cs)| This sample shows how to customize the pointer for a scale in a circular gauge. Gauge supports different types of pointers like marker, image, needle, and range. |
| [Multiple Scales](MultipleScales.cs)| This sample shows how to render and configure multiple scales in gauge. Use scale collection to render multiple scales in gauges. Each scale can be customized with its own pointer. |
| [Annotation](CircularGaugeAnnotation.cs)| Annotations are used to mark a specific area of interest in gauge with texts, shapes, or images. In this sample, minute and second sub-gauges are achieved using annotation feature. |
